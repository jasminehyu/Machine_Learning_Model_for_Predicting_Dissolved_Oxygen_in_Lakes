# Predicting Dissolved Oxygen Dynamics in Lake Mendota using Transfer Learning
### The project explores transfer learning models for predicting dissolved oxygen levels in Lake Mendota. 

- The approach addresses the challenge of limited data in environmental science by transferring underlying trends from related environments, enhancing prediction accuracy and reliability even with sparse target environment data. 

- The method involves pre-training the model with data from various lakes and fine-tuning it with Lake Mendota-specific data. Integrating scientific knowledge, such as understanding environmental factors affecting DO levels, into the machine learning process, offering improved predictions. 

- The findings demonstrate that transfer learning not only enhances prediction accuracy but also promotes scientific research and technological innovation with more precise and interpretable models.
